## WebGL Fundamentals

For this project I am learning how to use the basics of WebGL. I am using https://webgl2fundamentals.org to teach myself the API for my computer graphics course and of course for fun too :)

The main branch is dedicated to the initial set up of a webGL program and a simple render of a 2D square that can be moved on the X and Y axis using a slider. Other, more advanced examples can be found in different branches.

### Viewing examples
To run these examples clone and cd into the branch and do the following
'''
npm install
npm run dev
'''
This will run a development server hosted on port 3000 to view the example.
